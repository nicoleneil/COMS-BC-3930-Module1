# COMS-BC-3930-Module1
S.T.E.A.M. Inspired Generative Art - collaborative installation project

Description: This project displays a variety of words and phrases related to S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) which were generated by Chat GPT, while a ball in different colors rolls across the screen.  

Materials: 
ESP32 TTGO 
Usb-c cable
Laptop (MacBook Pro)
Solder
Soldering iron 
Crimp connector 
Wire 
Heat gun
Heat shrink wrap tubing 
220 mA battery
Envelope
Sharpie
Pen
Pencil
Eraser
Popsicle stick
String
Tape
Hole puncher

Process:
1. Configure Board and Port in the Tools section of the Arduino app for compatibility with your ESP32 TTGO. 
2. Prompt Chat GPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to generate 100 words related to S.T.E.A.M.
3. Develop program (in C++) for ESP32 TTGO on laptop (MacBook Pro) including Chat GPT generated text. 
4. Flash program from laptop to ESP32 TTGO via Usb-C (ensure that your Usb-c cable has all the necessary pins for this to work).

5. In pencil sketch the design on the enveloppe (S.T.E.A.M. icons). Draw the final designs on the envelope in Sharpie. Incorporate your initials into the design in pen. Use the eraser to remove and pencil marks remaining on the envelope.

6. Use the hole puncher to make holes in the envelope. Thread string through these holes and tie knots to secure the string. Tie the other ends of the strings to the popsicle stick and tape the knots down to secure them to the wood. 

7. Solder crimp connector to wire with Soldering iron (performed by Prof Santolucito).

8. Place a sectin of heat shrink wrap tubing over the soldered connection between the crimp connector and wire. Be sure to have hair and sleeves tied/pulled back to avoid injury and use the heat gun to melt the heat shrink wrap tubing to cover the soldered connection and prevent the black and red wires from touching.

9. Within the white connector end of the wire attached to the 220 mA battery, connect the black wire to the black wire of the battery  and connect the red wire to the red wire of the battery. Connect the white connector end of the wire to the port on the back of the ESP32 TTGO.

10. Place the ESP32 TTGO attached with wires to the battery into the decorated envelope and seal it with tape.

11. Hang the full project in the designated vent using the popsicle stick.
